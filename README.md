# Includes 'tuyaha' project:

Cloned from the abandoned package [tuyapy](https://pypi.org/project/tuyapy/) v0.1.3. This package implements a Tuya
API endpoint that was specially designed for Home Assistant.

This clone contains several critical fixes. Check commits.

## How to check whether the API this library using can control your device?

- Copy [this script](https://github.com/PaulAnnekov/tuyaha/blob/master/tools/debug_discovery.py) to your PC with Python
  installed or to https://repl.it/
- Set/update config inside and run it
- Check if your devices are listed
  - If they are - open an issue and provide the output
  - If they are not - don't open an issue. Ask [Tuya support](mailto:support@tuya.com) to support your device in their 
    `/homeassistant` API
- Remove the updated script, so your credentials won't leak

## Light temperature support by Xenomes

There's a fork of this plugin with support for light temperature control (for devices which support it), you can check it out at:
